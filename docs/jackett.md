# Setup Jackett

[Jackett](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett) translates request from Sonarr and Radarr to searches for torrents on popular torrent websites, even though those website do not have a sandard common APIs (to be clear: it parses html for many of them :)).

## Configuration and usage

Jackett web UI is available at `jackett.localhost`.

Configuration is available at the bottom of the page. I chose to disable auto-update (I'll rely on the docker images tags myself), and to set `/downloads` as my blackhole directory.

Click on `Add Indexer` and add any torrent indexer that you like. I added 1337x, cpasbien, RARBG, The Pirate Bay and YGGTorrent (need a user/password).

You can now perform a manual search across multiple torrent indexers in a clean interface with no trillion ads pop-up everywhere. Then choose to save the .torrent file to the configured blackhole directory, ready to be picked up by Deluge automatically !
