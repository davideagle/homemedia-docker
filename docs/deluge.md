# Setup Deluge

**_Note: The default configuration now uses qBittorrent, and this section will be updated soonâ„¢. The configuration is basically the same, so if you understand this guide you can configure qBittorrent pretty well too. Use `qbit.localhost` to access, with the default username `admin` and password `adminadmin`_**

## Configuration

You should now be able to login at `deluge.localhost`.

The default password is `deluge`. You are asked to modify it, I chose to set an empty one since deluge won't be accessible from outside my local network.

The running deluge daemon should be automatically detected and appear as online, you can connect to it.

You may want to change the download directory. I like to have to distinct directories for incomplete (ongoing) downloads, and complete (finished) ones.
Also, I set up a blackhole directory: every torrent file in there will be downloaded automatically. This is useful for Jackett manual searches.

You should activate `autoadd` in the plugins section: it adds supports for `.magnet` files.

You can also tweak queue settings, defaults are fairly small. Also you can decide to stop seeding after a certain ratio is reached. That will be useful for Sonarr, since Sonarr can only remove finished downloads from deluge when the torrent has stopped seeding. Setting a very low ratio is not very fair though !

Configuration gets stored automatically in your mounted volume (`${ROOT}/config/deluge`) to be re-used at container restart. Important files in there:

- `auth` contains your login/password
- `core.conf` contains your deluge configuration

You can use the Web UI manually to download any torrent from a .torrent file or magnet hash.

## Verify VPN is working

![Torrent guard](img/torrent_guard.png)

You can check that deluge is properly going out through the VPN IP by using [torguard check](https://torguard.net/checkmytorrentipaddress.php).
Get the torrent magnet link there, put it in Deluge, wait a bit, then you should see your outgoing torrent IP on the website.

If the VPN is properly working, you should see an ip address that is from the VPN, rather than your own.

You should check your current public IP [here](https://www.whatismyip.com/) against the listed one to make sure it works properly. It is important this works.
